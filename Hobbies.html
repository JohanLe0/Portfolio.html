        <h2>Art/drawing</h2>
        <p>I love drawing, although I don't do it often enough.
            It's the reason I started a graphic design course laste year, which I recently finished.
            This graphic design path has lead me to the web development path, which I'm very grateful for,
            since I really think I this suits me perfectly. It's the right balance between a technical aspect and a
            creative
            aspect.</p>

        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>I really like playing video games. I started at the start of my twenties when I was going through some really
            intense things,
            and I'm certain it has made that time a lot more tolerable than it would have been. I don't play as much
            these
            days because I'm focussed on learning for the most part. But I still enjoy it a lot when I do.

        <h2>Music/Guitar</h2>
        <p>I have to include music in general. I don't go a day without listening to music, and I like all sorts of genres. 
            Especially indie, hiphop and chill electronic music like deep house and liquid drum and bass. 
            But I also like to play the guitar. or at least I used to do it a lot, but the same as with the other things I don't do it as often as I would like. </p>

        <h2>Fitness</h2>
        <p>Sadly enough after I got covid in november I can't really enjoy this one too much either lately. 
            But I'm sure that will eventually change again. I used to love weight training, and riding my bike.
